Installation Instructions
*************************

Prerequisites: 
   1) hubo-ach (https://github.com/hubo/hubo-ach)
   2) RobotKin (https://github.com/mxgrey/RoboKin)
   3) drchubo-v2.urdf in /etc/hubo-ach/

0. This package uses cmake. If you're not sure whether you have cmake, put the following
into the terminal:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install cmake

It also depends on the Eigen C++ Library 3.0. Get it with the following command on Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

____________________________________________________________

1. Now use cmake to generate a Makefile:

In the top directory (ie. hubo-motion-rt) run the following commands into
the terminal:

(Make a build directory for the binaries to go in, if it doesn't already exist)
$ mkdir build

(Navigate to the newly created build directory)
$ cd build

(Run cmake to configure the project and create a Makefile)
$ cmake ..

This should generate a Makefile. You can use

$ ls
from the terminal to check that "Makefile" exists.

____________________________________________________________

2. Now you're ready to compile. Try the following:

$ make
(If an error occurs here, please contact mxgrey@gatech.edu)
Possible issues:

 -- Cannot link to libhuboparams.so or error: hubo-jointparams.h: No such file or directory:
    Make sure to install the latest version of hubo-ach (which means running "$ git pull",
    "$ autoreconf -i", "$ ./configure" and "$ sudo make install" in your hubo-ach directory.

 -- error: eigen3/Eigen/Core or eigen3/Eigen/Geometry: No such file or directory:
    Make sure you have installed eigen3 as instructed above and not eigen2.

$ sudo make install
(This will make the package system-wide and install the libraries)

____________________________________________________________

3. Everything should be ready to go.

If you try running the software according to the instructions in USAGE and you get something like
the following error:

"libhuboparams.so.x.x.x cannot be found" or "libdaemonizer.so.x.x.x cannot be found"

then the libraries were installed to a directory which is not in your ldconfig path. Feel free to
contact mxgrey@gatech.edu to figure out how to resolve the issue.

or compilation whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact the author.
